# Explainable AI (XAI) Analysis Report: Adult Income Dataset

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the implementation and evaluation of various Explainable AI (XAI) techniques on a machine learning model trained on the Adult Income dataset. The goal is to interpret the model's predictions and understand the factors influencing income classification decisions.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Dataset and Model
- **Dataset**: Adult Income dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Model**: LightGBM (Gradient Boosting) classifier
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (income > $50K or ≤ $50K)
- **Features**: 14 features including demographic and employment characteristics

### 2.2 Implemented XAI Techniques

#### 2.2.1 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- **Implementation**: Used SHAP library to calculate feature importance
- **Visualizations**:
  - Global feature importance
  - Individual prediction explanations
  - Feature interaction analysis
  - Dependence plots for top features

#### 2.2.2 LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- **Implementation**: Used LIME library for local explanations
- **Visualizations**:
  - Local explanations for individual predictions
  - Feature importance visualization
  - Decision boundary analysis

#### 2.2.3 Feature Importance Analysis
- **Implementation**: Combined LightGBM's built-in importance with SHAP values
- **Visualizations**:
  - Feature importance comparison
  - Feature type analysis (categorical vs numerical)

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 0.87 (87%)
- **ROC AUC**: 0.92
- **Precision**: 0.78
- **Recall**: 0.65
- **F1-Score**: 0.71

The model demonstrates strong performance with high accuracy and ROC AUC scores. The precision-recall trade-off shows that while the model is good at identifying high-income individuals (precision), it may miss some cases (lower recall).

### 3.2 XAI Results
